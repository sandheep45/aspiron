# AI Recall Check

AI Recall Check periodically assesses what you've remembered and guides targeted revision.

## What Is Recall Check

### Definition

AI Recall Check asks you to:

- Explain concepts in your own words
- No MCQs or multiple choice
- No marks or scores
- Focus on retention

### How It Works

1. AI identifies concepts you've learned
2. Calculates when you'll start forgetting
3. Sends recall reminder
4. You explain in your own words
5. AI evaluates your understanding
6. Provides targeted suggestions

## Memory Awareness

### Forgetting Curve

AI tracks:

- When you learned each concept
- How well you performed initially
- Time elapsed since learning
- Predicted forgetting point

### Proactive Nudges

Before you forget:

- AI sends recall reminder
- Suggests specific topics
- Estimates retention level
- Recommends review time

## Recall Process

### During Recall Check

1. AI presents topic
2. You explain in your own words
3. AI evaluates your explanation
4. Identifies gaps
5. Suggests targeted review

### AI Evaluation

AI assesses:

- **Remembered** - Full understanding
- **Partially Forgotten** - Some gaps
- **Forgotten** - Needs review
- **Misunderstood** - Incorrect concept

## After Recall Check

### Results Summary

You see:

- Concepts remembered
- Concepts partially forgotten
- Concepts forgotten
- Overall retention score

### Targeted Suggestions

AI provides:

- Exact video links (with timestamps)
- Relevant notes
- Focused quizzes
- Related test sections

### Guided Revision

Instead of overwhelming review:

- AI prioritizes what matters
- Breaks revision into chunks
- Suggests specific resources
- Tracks improvement over time

## Recall Frequency

### Smart Scheduling

AI schedules recalls based on:

- Concept difficulty
- Initial understanding
- Time since learning
- Your available time

### Not Too Frequent

Recall checks are:

- Respectful of your time
- Based on actual need
- Optional reminders
- Never forced

## Benefits

### Active Recall Over Passive Review

- You produce answers, not just recognize
- Strengthens memory
- Identifies gaps early
- More effective than re-reading

### Personalized Revision

- Targets your weak areas
- Maximizes study efficiency
- Reduces wasted time
- Improves retention

### Long-Term Learning

- Combat forgetting curve
- Build lasting knowledge
- Reduce cramming
- Improve exam performance
