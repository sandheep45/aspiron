# Learning Structure

Aspiron organizes content in a hierarchical structure that mirrors how exams are structured.

## Hierarchy Overview

```
EXAM (PGT / JEE / NEET)
    │
    └── SUBJECT (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology)
            │
            ├── CHAPTER (e.g., Mechanics, Thermodynamics)
            │       │
            │       └── TOPIC (e.g., Newton's Laws, Heat Transfer)
            │               │
            │               └── Concept 1
            │               └── Concept 2
            │               └── Practice Questions
            │
            ├── CHAPTER
