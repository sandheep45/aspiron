# Progress Tracking

Aspiron tracks learning progress across multiple dimensions to help students understand their journey.

## What Gets Tracked

### Completion Metrics

- **Syllabus Completion** - Percentage of topics completed
- **Chapter Progress** - Topics finished per chapter
- **Video Watch Time** - Content consumed
- **Quiz Attempts** - Practice questions attempted

### Performance Metrics

- **Quiz Accuracy** - Percentage of correct answers
- **Topic Mastery** - Mastery level per topic
- **Time Management** - Quiz timing patterns
- **Improvement Trends** - Accuracy over time

### Engagement Metrics

- **Study Time** - Time spent learning
- **Session Frequency** - How often students study
- **Note Creation** - Personal notes created
- **Forum Participation** - Doubts asked and answered

## Student View

### Dashboard Overview

The student dashboard shows:

- **Syllabus Progress** - Overall completion percentage
- **Subject Breakdown** - Progress per subject
- **Recent Activity** - Latest learning activities
- **Streak** - Consecutive days of study (non-toxic)

### Progress Visualizations

#### Progress Bars

- Subject-level progress
- Chapter-level progress
- Topic-level progress

#### Trend Lines

## Progress and Context

### Context-Aware Progress

Progress is always context-aware:

- Shows progress for your exam
- Filters by your subject
- Targets your target year
- Compares to relevant benchmarks

### Progress and AI

AI uses progress for:

- Personalized recommendations
- Recall Check scheduling
- Study plan generation
- Gap identification

## Privacy and Progress

### What Is Tracked

Aspiron tracks:

- Content completion
- Quiz performance
- Study patterns
- Engagement metrics

### What Is NOT Tracked

Aspiron does NOT track:

- Specific answers to questions
- Personal identifying information
- Data shared with third parties
- Behavior outside the platform

### Data Ownership

Students own their progress data:

- Can view all tracked data
- Can request data export (future)
- Can delete data (future)
- Can control data sharing

## Progress Sharing

### With Teachers

Students can share progress with teachers:
