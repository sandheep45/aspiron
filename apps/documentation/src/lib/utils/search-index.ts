    description: 'Introduction to Aspiron platform and its core philosophy',
    content:
      "\n> **Core**: This document describes Aspiron's foundational principles and will not change.\n\n# What is Aspiron?\n\nAspiron is a memory-aware, AI-guided learning platform for competitive exam preparation.\n\nBuilt for students preparing for:\n- **State PGT** (Post Graduate Teacher) exams\n- **JEE** (Joint Entrance Examination)\n- **NEET** (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)\n\n> **Planned**: Aspiron is architecturally exam-agnostic; these exams represent the initial focus, not a hard limitation.\n\n## The Problem We Solve\n\nMost learning platforms focus on content delivery. They dump videos, notes, and tests on students and hope learning happens.\n\nReal learning doesn't work that way. Students struggle with:\n\n- **Forgetting** - They watch a video today, forget it tomorrow\n- **Passive consumption** - Watching a video ≠ understanding the concept\n- **No revision strategy** - They don't know what to revisit or when\n- **Isolation** - They feel alone when stuck with a doubt\n\n> **Current**: The MVP addresses forgetting through AI Recall Check and isolation through the Community Bot.\n\n## What Aspiron Does Differently\n\nAspiron is built around three pillars: **retention, revision, and guided learning**.\n\n### Memory-Aware Architecture\n\nThe platform tracks what you've learned, when you learned it, and—when you start forgetting it—guides you back to the material.\n\nThis isn't gamification. It's infrastructure for long-term retention.\n\n### Recall-First Philosophy\n\nAspiron prioritizes **active recall** over passive review.\n\nTests ask you to **produce** answers, not just recognize them. Quizzes come with step-by-step solutions. AI asks you to explain concepts in your own words.\n\n### Context Persistence\n\nEverything in Aspiron knows:\n- Which exam you're preparing for\n- Which subject you're studying\n- Your target year\n\nThis context persists across videos, notes, quizzes, and AI interactions. You never have to re-explain your situation.\n\n### AI as Assistant, Not Replacement\n\nAI in Aspiron:\n- Explains concepts you don't understand\n- Identifies what you've forgotten\n- Summarizes content\n- Suggests what to revisit\n\nAI does NOT:\n- Take tests for you\n- Generate answers during exams\n- Replace your thinking\n\n### Community Without Noise\n\nPeer discussions exist for:\n- Doubt resolution\n- Knowledge sharing\n- Mutual support\n\nNo:\n- Follower counts\n- Like buttons\n- Viral content mechanics\n- Social pressure\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n> **Students first. AI second. Systems over motivation.**\n\nAspiron doesn't try to motivate you to study. It builds systems that make studying effective.\n\nMotivation is unreliable. A well-designed system works even when motivation doesn't.\n\n## Key MVP Features\n\n| Feature | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| Video learning with timestamps and bookmarks | Current |\n| Live classes with AI summaries | Current |\n| Teacher and student notes (private + shareable) | Current |\n| Practice quizzes with step-by-step solutions | Current |\n| Chapter tests and full mock exams | Current |\n| AI Recall Check - periodic memory assessments | Current |\n| Community Bot - virtual tutor and emotional support | Current |\n| Ethical notifications that respect your time | Current |\n| AI soft proctoring for mock exams | Current |\n| Peer discussion forum | Current |\n| Progress and syllabus tracking | Current |\n\n## Who Aspiron Is NOT For\n\nAspiron is NOT:\n- A place to download pirated content\n- A social network for likes and followers\n- An AI that writes your answers\n- A magic shortcut to cracking exams\n- A motivational app based on streaks and badges\n\nAspiron is for students who want to **actually learn and retain** what they study.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [MVP Scope](/docs/mvp-scope) - Understand what exists and what doesn't\n- More documentation coming soon\n",

    description: 'Day 1, daily, and revision workflows',
    content:
      '\n> **Current**: This document describes student workflows implemented in the MVP.\n\n# Student Journey\n\nAspiron supports students through their entire preparation journey—from Day 1 onboarding to final revision before the exam.\n\n## Day 1: Onboarding\n\n### Context Setup\n\nNew students begin by selecting their exam context. This selection persists across the entire platform:\n\n- **Exam Type** - State PGT, JEE, or NEET\n- **Subject** - Your primary study subject\n- **Target Year** - When you\'re taking the exam\n- **Language Preference** - Content language for AI and materials\n\n> **Core**: The context layer is foundational and applies to all features.\n\n### Exam Selection\n\nAspiron currently focuses on:\n- **State PGT** (Post Graduate Teacher) exams\n- **JEE** (Joint Entrance Examination)\n- **NEET** (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)\n\n> **Planned**: Aspiron is architecturally exam-agnostic; these exams represent the initial focus, not a hard limitation.\n\n### Initial Assessment (Optional)\n\nStudents may take an optional diagnostic assessment to:\n- Identify current knowledge level\n- Set baseline for progress tracking\n- Help AI prioritize what to review first\n\nThis assessment does NOT:\n- Gate access to content\n- Generate a "score" that affects the student\n- Compare students to each other\n\n### First Learning Session\n\nAfter context setup, students are guided to:\n1. Browse their syllabus\n2. Select their first topic\n3. Watch an introductory video\n4. Take a practice quiz\n5. Create their first timestamped note\n\n---\n\n## Daily Study Flow\n\nA typical study day follows this pattern:\n\n### Morning: New Content\n\n1. **Select Topic**\n   - Choose from syllabus based on AI recommendation or self-selection\n   - Progress tracking shows completion percentage\n\n2. **Watch Video**\n   - Playback speed control (0.5x to 2x)\n   - Resume from last position\n   - Add bookmarks at important moments\n   - Transcript available for search\n\n3. **Take Notes**\n   - Create notes while watching (auto-timestamped)\n   - Click timestamp to return to exact moment\n   - Notes linked to exam, subject, and topic\n\n4. **Practice Quiz**\n   - Complete MCQs and numericals for the topic\n   - Timer creates exam-like pressure\n   - Immediate feedback after submission\n\n### Afternoon: Deep Work\n\n1. **Review Notes**\n   - Revisit timestamped notes from morning\n   - AI suggests related content\n\n2. **Doubt Resolution**\n   - Post questions in peer forum\n   - Tag with exam, subject, topic\n   - Community Bot may suggest similar answered doubts\n\n### Evening: Active Recall\n\n1. **AI Recall Check** (periodic, not daily)\n   - AI asks what you remember from recent topics\n   - You explain concepts in your own words\n   - AI identifies gaps and suggests review\n\n2. **Revision Mode**\n   - Review wrong questions from past quizzes\n   - Flashcard-style formula review\n   - AI summary of key points\n\n---\n\n## Weekly Cycle\n\nAspiron is designed for sustainable weekly rhythm:\n\n| Day | Focus |\n|-----|-------|\n| Monday | New chapter content |\n| Tuesday | New chapter content |\n| Wednesday | Practice quizzes + note review |\n| Thursday | New chapter content |\n| Friday | Mixed review + AI Recall Check |\n| Saturday | Full mock exam (chapter or section) |\n| Sunday | Rest + light revision only |\n\n> **Note**: This is a suggested pattern. Students can customize their schedule.\n\n---\n\n## Monthly Progression\n\n### Syllabus Completion Tracking\n\nStudents see:\n- Topics completed vs. total\n- Time spent per topic\n- Subject-wise breakdown\n\n### AI-Generated Insights\n\nMonthly, AI provides:\n- Topics most frequently forgotten\n- Quiz accuracy trends\n- Recommended focus areas for next month\n\n### Milestone Checkpoints\n\nAt syllabus completion milestones:\n- Diagnostic assessment\n- Full mock exam recommendation\n- AI study plan for remaining topics\n\n---\n\n## Revision Flow\n\nRevision is where Aspiron differs from other platforms.\n\n### The Revision Problem\n\nMost platforms:\n- Show you content to review\n- Hope you remember it\n- Track completion, not retention\n\n### The Aspiron Solution\n\n1. **AI Tracks Forgetting**\n   - Platform knows when you learned each concept\n   - AI predicts when you\'ll start forgetting\n   - Proactive nudges for review\n\n2. **Active Recall Over Passive Review**\n   - Instead of "read this again," AI asks "explain this"\n   - You produce answers, not just recognize them\n   - Wrong answers trigger targeted review\n\n3. **Guided, Not Overwhelming**\n   - AI doesn\'t dump 100 topics to review\n   - Prioritizes what matters most\n   - Breaks revision into manageable chunks\n\n### Revision Mode Access\n\nStudents enter revision mode through:\n- AI Recall Check notifications\n- Wrong questions list\n- Formula quick-reference\n- AI-generated summaries\n\n---\n\n## Test Day Preparation\n\nBefore a mock exam or the real exam:\n\n### Pre-Exam Week\n\n1. **Focus on Weak Areas**\n   - AI identifies top 5 topics to review\n   - Targeted quizzes on weak concepts\n   - Formula flashcards\n\n2. **Full Mock Exam**\n   - Simulates real exam conditions\n   - AI proctoring active\n   - No AI assistance during exam\n\n### Post-Exam Analysis\n\nAfter each mock exam:\n- Accuracy breakdown by topic\n- Time management insights\n- Mistake patterns identified\n- Clear "what to do next" plan\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Motivation\n\nAspiron doesn\'t use streaks or gamification.

      "\n> **Core**: This document describes the foundational design principles that guide Aspiron's development.\n\n# Design Philosophy\n\nAspiron is built on a set of core principles that shape every feature, interaction, and decision.\n\n## Students First, AI Second\n\nEverything starts with the student's needs, not AI's capabilities.\n\n### What This Means\n\n- AI exists to serve students, not the other way around\n- AI features are evaluated by student outcomes, not engagement metrics\n- AI is always an assistant, never a replacement for thinking\n- Students own their learning; AI supports it\n\n### What This Doesn't Mean\n\n- AI is hidden or disabled\n- Students are left alone to figure everything out\n- AI suggestions are ignored\n\n## Systems Over Motivation\n\nMotivation is unreliable. Systems are reliable.\n\n### The Motivation Problem\n\nMost learning platforms rely on:\n- Streaks (motivation through fear of loss)\n- Badges (motivation through rewards)\n- Leaderboards (motivation through competition)\n- Notifications (motivation through nagging)\n\nThese work short-term. They fail long-term.\n\n### The Aspiron Approach\n\nInstead of motivation, Aspiron builds systems that:\n\n1. **Make learning effective** - Active recall, spaced repetition, contextual help\n2. **Remove friction** - Auto-save, timestamps, resume from where you left\n3. **Guide without nagging** - AI knows when to nudge, and respects your time\n4. **Track real progress** - Not completion, but retention and mastery\n\n## Retention Over Completion\n\nCompleting a video ≠ learning a concept.\n\n### The Completion Fallacy\n\nMost platforms measure:\n- Videos watched\n- Quizzes taken\n- Time spent\n\nThese are vanity metrics. They don't measure learning.\n\n### What Aspiron Measures\n\n- **Retention** - What did you remember after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month?\n- **Recall** - Can you produce the answer, not just recognize it?\n- **Mastery** - Can you apply the concept to new problems?\n\nAI Recall Check exists specifically to measure and improve retention.\n\n## Context Persistence\n\nStudents shouldn't have to repeat themselves.\n\n### The Context Problem\n\nIn most platforms:\n- AI doesn't know what exam you're preparing for\n- Videos don't know which subject you're studying\n- Quizzes don't know your target year\n\nStudents constantly re-explain their situation.\n\n### The Aspiron Solution\n\nContext is foundational:\n\n- Exam type persists across all features\n- Subject selection persists across all features\n- Target year persists across all features\n- AI always knows your context\n- Content is filtered by your context\n\n## Privacy By Design\n\nStudent data is their own.\n\n### What Aspiron Doesn't Do\n\n- Sell student data\n- Show student progress publicly\n- Share data with third parties for advertising\n- Track students across the internet\n\n### What Students Control\n\n- Who sees their notes (private, peers, community)\n- Whether their forum posts are anonymous\n- Whether to share progress with teachers (later phases)\n\n## AI As Assistant, Not Replacement\n\nAI helps you learn, not learn for you.\n\n### AI Helps By\n\n- Explaining concepts you don't understand\n- Identifying what you've forgotten\n- Summarizing long content\n- Suggesting what to review next\n- Generating practice questions (future)\n\n### AI Never\n\n- Takes tests for you\n- Generates answers during exams\n- Writes your notes or assignments\n- Makes decisions about your learning\n\n## Community Without Noise\n\nPeer support without social media toxicity.\n\n### Community Features\n\n- Doubt resolution forum\n- Peer study groups (future)\n- Community Bot for guidance\n\n### Community Exclusions\n\n- No follower/following counts\n- No likes or reactions\n- No viral content mechanics\n- No public leaderboards\n\n## Honest About Scope\n\nAspiron is clear about what exists and what doesn't.\n\n### Document Status\n\nEvery feature is labeled:\n\n- **Core** - Will not change\n- **Current** - Implemented or near-term\n- **Planned** - Directional, not guaranteed\n\n### What This Means\n\n- We don't promise features we haven't built\n- \"Planned\" means intention, not commitment\n- Students know what's available now vs. what's coming\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts) - Learn the foundational architecture\n- [Roadmap](/docs/roadmap) - See where Aspiron is heading\n- [AI Recall Check](/docs/ai-recall-check) - See retention in action\n",

      "\n> **Core**: This document describes the context layer, which is foundational to Aspiron's architecture.\n\n# Context Layer\n\nThe context layer is Aspiron's foundational architecture. It ensures every feature knows who you are and what you're preparing for.\n\n## What Is Context?\n\nContext is the set of parameters that define a student's learning journey:\n\n- **Exam Type** - State PGT, JEE, or NEET\n- **Subject** - Primary study subject\n- **Target Year** - When the exam is scheduled\n- **Language Preference** - Content language for AI and materials\n\n## Why Context Matters\n\n### The Problem Without Context\n\nIn most learning platforms:\n\n- AI doesn't know which exam you're preparing for\n- Videos aren't filtered by your subject\n- Quizzes don't match your exam pattern\n- You constantly re-explain your situation\n\n### The Aspiron Solution\n\nContext is foundational. Everything starts with it.\n\n## Context Initialization\n\n### Onboarding Flow\n\nNew students go through context setup:\n\n1. **Select Exam**\n   - PGT (Post Graduate Teacher)\n   - JEE (Joint Entrance Examination)\n   - NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test)\n\n2. **Select Subject**\n   - Filtered by exam (different subjects available per exam)\n\n3. **Set Target Year**\n   - Determines content relevance and urgency\n\n4. **Choose Language**\n   - Content language for AI and materials\n\n### Context Persistence\n\nOnce set, context persists across:\n\n- Video recommendations\n- Quiz generation\n- AI chat interactions\n- Note organization\n- Forum threads\n- Progress tracking\n- Notification prioritization\n\n## Context in Action\n\n### Videos\n\n```\nExam: JEE + Subject: Physics + Target: 2026\n→ Shows: JEE Physics videos\n→ Hides: NEET Physics, JEE Chemistry\n```\n\n### Quizzes\n\n```\nExam: NEET + Subject: Biology + Target: 2026\n→ Generates: NEET-style MCQs\n→ Timing: NEET exam duration\n→ Pattern: NEET marking scheme\n```\n\n### AI Chat\n\n```\nUser asks: \"Explain this concept\"\nAI knows: Exam=JEE, Subject=Physics, Target=2026\n→ Explains in JEE context\n→ Uses Physics terminology\n→ Links to relevant JEE topics\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n```\nStudent creates note\n→ Automatically tagged with: Exam, Subject, Topic\n→ Organized by context\n→ Shareable within same context\n```\n\n### Forum\n\n```\nUser posts doubt\n→ Posted to: Exam → Subject → Topic\n→ Viewable by: Same exam/subject students\n→ Answered by: Peers with same context\n```\n\n## Context and AI\n\n### How AI Uses Context\n\n- **Recall Check** - Asks about concepts relevant to your exam\n- **Chat** - Explains in your exam's context\n- **Recommendations** - Suggests content you need for your exam\n- **Analysis** - Identifies gaps specific to your exam pattern\n\n### AI Boundaries\n\nAI never:\n- Mixes content from wrong exams\n- Recommends irrelevant topics\n- Ignores your target year\n\n## Changing Context\n\n### Can Students Change Context?\n\nYes. Students can update:\n\n- **Subject** - If preparing multiple subjects\n- **Target Year** - If exam date changes\n- **Language** - If preference changes\n\n### Cannot Change\n\n- **Exam Type** - Once selected, locked for that account\n\n> **Planned**: Multi-exam support may come in future phases.\n\n## Context and Privacy\n\n### What Context Stores\n\n- Exam selection\n- Subject choice\n- Target year\n- Language preference\n\n### What Context Does NOT Store\n\n- Personal identifying information\n- Learning data (stored separately)\n- Progress data (stored separately)\n\n### Data Isolation\n\nContext is separate from:\n\n- **Progress Data** - What's been completed\n- **Performance Data** - Quiz scores, accuracy\n- **Behavioral Data** - Time spent, patterns\n\n## Context and Teachers\n\n### Teacher Context\n\nTeachers see context when:\n\n- Viewing student progress\n- Creating content\n- Answering forum doubts\n\n### Teacher Content\n\nTeachers create content within their context:\n\n- Videos tagged with exam/subject\n- Notes linked to specific syllabus\n- Quizzes matching exam pattern\n\n## Future Context Expansion\n\n### Planned Additions\n\n- **Multiple Exams** - Prepare for more than one exam\n- **Custom Contexts** - Institution-specific contexts\n- **Dynamic Context** - Context that evolves with progress\n\n### Core Principle\n\nContext will always remain:\n\n- Foundational to architecture\n- Privacy-respecting\n- Learning-focused\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- [Learning Structure](/docs/learning-structure) - See how content is organized\n- [Notes System](/docs/notes-system) - Learn about notes architecture\n- [AI Recall Check](/docs/ai-recall-check) - See context-aware revision\n- [Progress Tracking](/docs/progress-tracking) - Understand metrics\n",
